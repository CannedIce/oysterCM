This html file contains an interactive diagram documenting the effects of expected near-term changes of the physical environment on oyster populations in the US. This diagram is designed to help project planning teams determine the likely impact of changing environmental conditions on planned oyster restoration projects and scope any required hydrodynamic and water quality modeling required to inform oyster restoration planning.

There are nine pages containing clickable layers that describe environmental drivers and/or model inputs that affect oyster life history processes. Clickable items are represented by bold text and shadowed boxes. Specific processes are highlighted in light blue. To turn off a layer, click anywhere on the diagram again. The pages are as follows:
 - Main diagram page with links to all other pages
 - Larval growth
 - Larval mortality
 - Juvenile growth
 - Juvenile mortality
 - Adult growth
 - Adult reprodcution
 - Adult mortality
 - Reef degradation

The life stage icon in the lower left corner of each page will return the user to the main page. Linkages between life history processes are also represented where applicable. Reference specific to each page are viewable by clicking the "View references" link in the lower right corner. If you would like to view the html on the website, please use the following link to render the diagram directly from this repository.
